but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man
and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together
and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean
therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me
and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing
